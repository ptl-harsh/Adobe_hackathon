      "content": "Qualifications Board \nInternational \nOverview \nSoftware Testing \nFoundation Level Extension – Agile Tester \n2. Introduction to Foundation Level Agile Tester Extension \nThe certification for Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester is designed for professionals who are \nworking within Agile environments. It is also for professionals who are planning to start implementing \nAgile methods in the near future, or are working within companies that plan to do so, The certification \nprovides an advantage for those who would like to know the required Agile activities, roles, methods, and \nmethodologies specific to their role. \n2.1 Intended Audience \nThe Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester qualification is aimed at four main groups of professionals: \n1. Professionals who have achieved in-depth testing experience in traditional methods and would \nlike to get an Agile Tester Certificate. \n2. Junior professional testers who are just starting in the testing profession, have received the \nFoundation Level certificate, and would like to know more about the tester’s role in an Agile \nenvironment. \n3. Professionals who are relatively new to testing and are required to implement test approaches, \nmethods and techniques in their day to day job in Agile projects. \n4. Professionals who are experienced in their role (including unit testing) and need more \nunderstanding and knowledge about how to perform and manage testing on all levels in Agile \nprojects. \nThese professionals include people who are in roles such as testers, test analysts, test engineers, test \nconsultants, test managers, user acceptance testers, and software developers. \nThis Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester certification may also be appropriate for anyone who \nwants a deeper understanding of software testing in the Agile world, such as project managers, quality \nmanagers, software development managers, business analysts, IT directors, and management \nconsultants. \n2.2 Career Paths for Testers \nBuilding on the Foundation Level, the Agile Tester Extension supports the definition of career paths for \nprofessional testers. A person with the Agile Tester certificate has extended the broad understanding of \ntesting acquired at the Foundation Level to enable him or her to work effectively as a professional tester in \nan Agile project.  \nPeople possessing an ISTQB Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester certificate may use the Certified \nTester Foundation Level acronym CTFL-AT. \n2.3 Learning Objectives \nIn general, the Foundation Level syllabus is examinable at a K1 level, i.e., the candidate will recognize, \nremember and recall terms and concepts stated in the Foundation Level syllabus. \nIn addition, all Foundation Level syllabus learning objectives are examinable at the same K- level in an \nextension exam. \nVersion 2014 \nPage 7 of 12 \nMay 31, 2014 \n© International Software Testing Qualifications Board",

      "content": "capabilities. The challenge is to secure resources sufficient to both sustain the original investments and \nto enhance the ODL. \nThe ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants \n(i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are \nexpected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the \nODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants \n(university, colleges, public libraries and schools). \nThe proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as \nthe ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental \nsources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to \nenable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed \nendowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart \noutlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions: \n1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period \n2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period \n3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55% \nduring the same period \nOVERVIEW OF ODL FUNDING MODEL \nFunding Source \n2007 \n2017 \nGovernment \n$35M (70%) \n$33.75M (45%) \nLibraries \n$10M (20%) \n$22.5M (30%) \nEndowment \n$4.5M (9%) \n$15M (20%) \nGifts/In-Kind \n$0.5M (1%) \n$3.75M (5%) \nTOTAL ANNUAL \n$50M\n$75M\nWhile the private sector will be invited to participate in the ODL through the endowment, gifts and in-\nkind contributions, the ODL will also explore compatible commercial services which leverage the reach \nof the ODL and help to offset operating costs. \nA $50M budget leverages the consortium buying power of the province’s libraries to secure the best \nprices for information resources, the widest accessibility and the most favourable contracts. A budget of \nthis nature will ensure a core digital collection of sufficient scope and coverage to address a substantial \namount of the wide and diverse information and learning needs of the citizens of Ontario (an overview \nof the nature of the ODL digital collection is appended). The proposed ODL expenditures in 2006 \nrepresent an investment of $5.00 per citizen. \nIt is important to recognize that every new dollar per citizen invested in the Ontario Digital Library has a \ndouble benefit: it supports a province-wide library of high quality information resources and it \nstrengthens every local library in Ontario by allowing them to reinvest existing dollars in new resources \nthat enhance local services. This multiplier means that for every dollar invested in ODL the return \non investment is worth $2 of value for Ontario. \nRFP: To Develop the Ontario Digital Library Business Plan\n March 2003 \n10\n10\n10\n10",
